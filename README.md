# todo-api
Simple django/rest_framework todo list API. Fork the repo and run locally during development of your front-end application.

## Instructions
Fork this repo then clone locally to run the server during development. Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

In a separate repo, create a single-page application using ReactJS (https://facebook.github.io/react/) and materializecss (http://materializecss.com/) to interact with this API.

## Requirements
Your single page application should give the ability to:
1. View all todo list items

1. Filter todo items by "done" status

1. Create a new todo item

1. Update todo item description

1. Toggle the "done" status

1. Delete a selected todo item

1. Delete all "done" items

## Design
Pixel perfect design is not the goal with this exercise, but generally the resulting front end should like this example:
